# Sticky notes

Windows, or at least a few versions of the operating system, has a neat desktop app called **Sticky Notes**. The goal of this repository is to recreate the essence of the application with the Tauri framework. There are of course a few concessions you have to make with the result, but already I consider it a proud achievement â€” Gabriele Corti.
